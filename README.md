# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart disease is one of the biggest reason for death across the globe. As it is a cause of 35% of total death across worldwide
Artificial Intelligence can play an essential role in predicting Heart Diseases.
The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made 
with different algorithms Decision Tree, Random Forest,SVM,Navie Bayies, XGBoost.

Algorithms used:

Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
